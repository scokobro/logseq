## COURSE NAME
13438:IR18‐EE233 Cultural Awareness and Communication (RB) § 13439:IR-ECS201 Cross-Cultural Communication (RB) § 13440:RUIR-2232 Cultural Awareness and Communication (course jointly designed)(RB)
## OUTLINE AND METHOD
This course offers a critical approach to the field of Cross-Cultural Communication by introducing students to ideas of 'culture' and 'identity'. An understanding of these two concepts is fundamental to all human interaction and a knowledge of the worldwide variations found will enhance the ability of students to communicate successfully across boundaries at all levels. We also look at the importance of language in understanding cultures, and variations in fundamental understandings of such concepts as 'space' and 'time' which are shared by human beings around the world. The emphasis of the course is on human commonalities, rather than surface differences.
## ATTAINMENT OBJECTIVES
Students will acquire a broad-based understanding of the development of social and academic understandings of ‘culture’ and will examine how these various approaches continue to interact in contemporary discussions which make use the idea of culture. The course draws on a wide variety of materials drawn from such diverse disciplines as evolutionary biology, developmental and social psychology, sociolinguistics, and so on. In this way it attempts to break down the nebulous field of ‘culture’ into better defined areas, open to more rigorous examination.

Students will examine the sources of their own notions of culture, and those they may have been introduced to through formal education; the importance attached to language in defining ‘cultural’ groupings, and the potential artificiality of groups so defined; the various means to which modern states have put ‘culture’. They will also look at a variety of academic approaches used in discussions of culture, and intercultural communication, and examine the assumptions behind those approaches and their resulting relative strengths and limitations.

Students will ask significant questions about the significance of potential definitions of culture, the feasibility of such constructs as ‘national cultures’ and ‘national languages’, and the motivations which are perhaps at the root of societies’ continuing interest in using notions of ‘culture’ as an ideological tool.

Upon successful completion of this course students will:
• have started to develop critical skills which allow them to understand, assess and evaluate information in relation to its cultural context
• have had opportunity to reflect on their own cultural identity and how it may influence their interaction with individuals from different cultures
• be aware of and understand a variety of approaches to the concept of 'culture'
• be aware of similarities and differences across a variety types of human social groups
