## Oscar's birthday
## did a live session for CAC-2 - noone showed up..
## chat w Qili at 2ish - he tends to overthink and require theoretical justification for common knowledge - advised he simplify
## video chat for grad zemi - first time to see GAO Man, Fang Hao, LIU Youping - also pres - Enzo, Tiage, Rungu
## mail later from Bruno - he seems out of the loop a bit
## visited library for books on general 'media theory' - how to introduce what it means to students.
## after work down to Shijo to order burgers, and collect cake - pint in Hub while waiting
## Oscar book arrived - short takes
## Miho feeling bad, maybe a cold
## Olivia also looking tired
